# AraMAData
AraMAData is a high-quality Arabic reading comprehension dataset developed to support a wide range of NLP tasks, including question answering, multiple-choice question generation, text classification, and information retrieval. The dataset consists of 1,000 curated passages sourced from Arabic Wikipedia, covering 15 distinct subject areas such as science, history, education, culture, and social studies. It includes approximately 3,000 manually crafted multiple-choice questions, each linked to a specific passage and accompanied by one correct answer and three pedagogically relevant distractors.

Each question is further annotated according to Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, enabling classification across cognitive levels such as knowledge, comprehension, and application. The dataset is linguistically rich, thematically diverse, and designed to support both educational assessment and Arabic-language NLP research.
